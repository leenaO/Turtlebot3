What is SLAM
-------------------------

SLAM stands for Simultaneous localization and mapping.

it is a technology used for robot to localize its own position and construct a map in an unknown environment.

Sensors
-------------------------

SLAM uses several different types of sensors:

•	A LiDAR-based SLAM system uses a laser sensor to generate a 3D map of its environment.

•	Visual SLAM, typically tracks points of interest through successive camera frames to triangulate the 3D position of the camera, this information is then used to build a 3D map. 

TurtleBot3
-------------------------

is a new generation mobile robot.

let we use SLAM with TurtleBot!

so we want to create a map of the TurtleBot environment.

to do that we will use Rviz and Gazebo on ubuntu.

Open this link https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/#pc-setup, go to the menue and choose from Quick Start Guide list > Pc setup, then do all the instructions.

after that choose Gazebo simulation then SLAM simulation from simulation list and complete the instructions.
you can do the map now!

this is my result:
